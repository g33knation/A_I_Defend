# UI Improvements - A_I_Defend Dashboard

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Elements
- **Removed duplicate "Quick Scan" button** from the header
  - Kept the contextual "Quick Scan" button in the System Status card
  - Header now only has the "Refresh Data" button for cleaner UI

### 2. Fixed Stats Cards Layout
- **Corrected grid structure** for the 4 stats cards (Total Events, Open Detections, Threats Blocked, False Positives)
  - All 4 cards now properly contained within the grid container
  - Cards display in a responsive 1/2/4 column layout (mobile/tablet/desktop)
  - Fixed indentation and closing tags

### 3. Fixed API Endpoints
- **Updated Quick Scan endpoint** from `/api/scan/quick` (404) to `/api/scans/start`
  - Added proper request body with scanner configuration
  - Added Content-Type header
  - Scans now work correctly

### 4. UI Polish
- Added `shadow-sm` class to Refresh Data button for consistency
- Maintained modern, clean design with:
  - Rounded corners (`rounded-xl`, `rounded-lg`)
  - Subtle shadows and hover effects
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Smooth transitions
